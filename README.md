# Hi, I’m Rifat (Shaon) 👋

I’m on a journey to become a **data analyst / data engineer**, using my background in **cloud-based services and operations** to build modern, end-to-end data solutions.

---

What I’m focused on now

- **Data analytics & data engineering**
-  Projects with **Python, SQL, Docker + SQL Server/PostgreSQL**
-  Building simple **ETL/ELT pipelines** and data models
-  Dashboards and insights using tools like **Tableau / Power BI–style workflows

---

## My previous background

Before going deep into data analytics, I spent most of my time around **cloud and DevOps**:

- 🎓 Master’s degree in **Cloud-Based Services and Operations** (OsloMet)
- ☁️ Concepts: cloud architecture, scalability, monitoring, reliability
- 🛠️ Exposure to **DevOps thinking**:
  - CI/CD basics  
  - containerization (Docker)  
  - automation mindset  
- 🌐 Interest in **Azure** and modern cloud platforms

This cloud background helps me think about **data platforms**, not just queries and charts.

##  What I’m looking for

- Collaboration on **data analytics** or **entry-level data engineering** projects  
- Real-world datasets to analyse (city data, business data, public datasets)  
- Opportunities where **cloud + data** can be combined

If you have a dataset or idea and want to explore it, I’d love to help.
